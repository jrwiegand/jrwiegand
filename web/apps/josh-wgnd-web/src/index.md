# Hey.

## My name is Josh Wiegand.

<img class="profile" src="assets/profile.png">

I craft computer bits and bytes to help people get things done. I enjoy learning and talking about most topics including but not limited new tech (software and hardware), movies, lawn care, house projects, you get the picture.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshrwiegand) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/josh.wiegand/) where I infrequently post about anything. I also do my best to stay active on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrwiegand), opening the occasional PR.

When I am not programming, I am likely helping my wife raise our two kids, playing or watching sports (especially basketball), fixing a thing, taking in a movie, mowing the grass, reading a book or doing something else that is vitally important for the next two minutes.
