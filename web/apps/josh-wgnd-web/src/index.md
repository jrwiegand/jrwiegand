<h1>Hey. ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h2>My name is Josh Wiegand.</h2>
<p>
	I craft computer bits and bytes to help people get things done. I enjoy learning and talking
	about most topics including but not limited new tech (software and hardware), movies, lawn
	care, house projects, you get the picture.
</p>

<p>
	You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/joshrwiegand">Twitter</a> or
	<a href="https://www.instagram.com/josh.wiegand/">Instagram</a> where I infrequently post
	about anything. I also do my best to stay active on
	<a href="https://github.com/jrwiegand"> GitHub</a>, opening the occasional PR.
</p>
<p>
	When I am not programming, I am likely helping my wife raise our two kids, playing or
	watching sports (especially basketball), fixing a thing, taking in a movie, mowing the
	grass, reading a book or doing something else that is vitally important for the next two
	minutes.
