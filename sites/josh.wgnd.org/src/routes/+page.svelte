	<p>
		I craft computer bits and bytes to help people. I enjoy learning and talking many topics
		including new tech, movies, lawn care, house projects, etc.

		where I infrequently post about anything. I also do my best to stay active on
		<a href="https://github.com/jrwiegand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>,
		opening the occasional PR.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I am not programming, I am likely helping my wife raise our two kids, playing or watching
		sports (especially basketball), fixing a thing, taking in a movie, mowing the grass, reading a
		book or doing something else that is vitally important for the next five minutes.
