	<p>
		I craft computer bits and bytes to help people. I enjoy learning and talking
		many topics including new tech, movies, lawn care, house projects, etc.

	<p>
		When I am not programming, I am likely helping my wife raise our two kids,
		playing or watching sports (especially basketball), fixing a thing, taking
		in a movie, mowing the grass, reading a book or doing something else that is
		vitally important for the next five minutes.
