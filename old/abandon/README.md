# Abandon

**Survive alone in deep space, can you make it back home?!**

You're an abandoned space craft in an enemy asteroid field. You must do all you can to survive and make your way home.
Can you do what it takes to survive?

## About

Created in my spare time with [KTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) by a single developer
([me](https://joshwiegand.com)).

## Assets

Well, it _is_ a side project with limited extra free time. The project includes examples loading assets on demand
(not via an asynchronous asset manager) and so on. It isn't exactly a prime example of a well-structured
[KTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) game and of what the framework can do, but - well - it got the job done.
Don't judge me by this code. It is a work in progress.
